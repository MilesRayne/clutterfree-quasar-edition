# Important

This is a work-in-progress project of mine.
I'm trying to integrate Quasar with Vue 3 and Vite into the existing Clutterfree for Anilist codebase.

## Features

- Groups together sequential activities by the same user into a single card that can be expanded when needed.
- Customizable settings let the user choose whether to group by user or only group activity likes, which are more spammable.

## Installation

[**Chrome Extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clutterfree-for-anilist/hfgmcmijjnccacoefjdndepfkbaejllb)

[**Firefox Add-on**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clutterfree-for-anilist/)

## Planned changes and features

- Compact activity feed option.
- Additional decluttering of other AniList tabs and pages.
